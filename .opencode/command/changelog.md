Create `UPCOMING_CHANGELOG.md` from the structured changelog input below.
If `UPCOMING_CHANGELOG.md` already exists, ignore its current contents.

The input already contains the commit range and a first-pass grouping. Do not fetch GitHub releases, PRs, or build your own commit list.

Before keeping an entry, inspect the real diff with `git show --stat --format='' <hash>` or `git show --format='' <hash>` so the notes are based on behavior, not only the commit subject.

Rules:

- Write release notes for users of the `patchlane` CLI.
- Keep sections in this order: `## Features`, `## Improvements`, `## Bugfixes`.
- Only include sections that have at least one notable entry.
- Keep one bullet per commit you keep.
- Skip changes that are entirely internal, CI-only, tests-only, formatting-only, or release mechanics.
- Start each bullet with a capital letter.
- Prefer user-facing outcomes over implementation details.
- Do not copy raw commit prefixes like `fix:` or `feat:`.
- Do not include file lists in the final output.
- If no notable entries remain, write exactly `No notable changes.`
- Be concise; release notes should be easy to skim.
